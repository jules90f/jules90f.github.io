Introduction

Objectives:

1. Create New Customer Document Pack

2. Migrate Documentation to Another Documentation Platform (GrooveHQ, Wiki, or GitHub Pages)

3. Maintain Documentation

Intended Audience: External and internal customers

Deadline: May 12, 2017 for Phases 1 and 2, TBD for Phases 3-5

# Project Scope

This documentation project is divided into five (5) phases:

1. Planning / Scope Finalization for New Customer Document Pack

    1. Keeping the intended audience in mind, identify content that is potentially useful to customers, e.g. Hospital Staff, Hospital IT Staff/Power Users/Developer (Thai and Jules)

    2. Once content for inclusion is identified, prioritize to meet deadline (Jay)

    3. Finalize list of documents to be included (Jay, with inputs from Thai and Jules) 

**NOTE: **Documents under scope of project can be found using the saved New Customer Document Pack? = Yes filter on [00 PatientWay Documentation Index (In-progress)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Ew2TL0k1GbsKexdT7MG4VuTnQ89tsEtP8p_JPczRDcc/edit#gid=0&fvid=226453154). 

1. Documentation Proper (Jules, with assistance from Thai and Jay)

    1. Will include rewriting existing documentation to conform to generally-accepted standards (follow Microsoft Style Guide for Technical Publications and Sun Style Guide for the Computer Industry)

    2. Will focus on content

    3. To save on time, use existing screenshots, unless absolutely necessary to create new ones

    4. Jules will be the person-in-charge of the documentation, with Thai and Jay providing assistance through their expertise of the subject domain. 

    5. Thai will also continue to work on the documents he has started writing, with Jules editing them to conform to standards.

2. Migration of New Customer Document Pack (and other documents?)  from Google Docs to GrooveHQ, Wiki, or GitHub Pages, or some other platform

    6. GrooveHQ

        1. Pros

            1. I've looked at GrooveHQ, and it seems similar to Zendesk, Freshdesk, and other Cloud-based KB tools which Iâ€™ve used before.

            2. If PatientWay already uses GrooveHQ, the KB is probably already part of  a paid license, as it is with Zendesk and similar tools.

            3. Probably better- and more modern-looking than the Wiki.

            4. If the same with other tools, more granular security access, thus making it suitable for internal documents

        2. Cons

            5. Might need to reformat the current Documentation Set into smaller chunks suitable for knowledge bases.

    7. Wiki

        3. Pros

            6. Free, as you can host it on your own website.

        4. Cons

            7. Might take time, as we still don't know if the Markdown format that the tool we are eyeing for migrating the documentation ([http://thiscouldbejd.github.io/Gabriel/](http://thiscouldbejd.github.io/Gabriel/)) can be imported into the Wiki as-is.

            8. Barebones look-and-feel

    8. GitHub Pages

        5. Pros

            9. Completely free, with no hosting fees necessary.

            10. Might compare favorably with GrooveHQ when it comes to look-and-feel

        6. Cons

            11. Might take time, as we still don't know if the Markdown format that the tool we are eyeing for migrating the documentation ([http://thiscouldbejd.github.io/Gabriel/](http://thiscouldbejd.github.io/Gabriel/)) can be imported into the GitHub Pages as-is.

**NOTE: **May take place after May 5, in case Phase 2 isn't done before then. All three will require organizing the current Documentation Repository into a more manageable structure.

3. Create a New Documentation Index for all documents migrated to the new platform and Google Docs (for internal marketing-related and other materials)

    9. Documentation Index will be revamped to make it more manageable and easier to understand.

    10. This will help when it comes to Phase 5 of the project, which is maintenance of the documentation.

    11. Help ease transition of new PatientWay team members, including anyone who takes over the documentation in the future

4. Documentation Maintenance (to be covered in a separate scoping and schedule document)

    12. Ensure that all documentation conform to standards

    13. Update procedures and screenshots in existing documents 

**NOTE:** If ALL existing documentation will be included in Phase 3, the complexity of the current Documentation Index might carry over to the new Documentation Platform, making it difficult to use. In this case, and before proceeding with Phase 3, I propose that we look at dividing the documentation into the following main sections before proceeding with Phase 3 (this is a preliminary structure, and still subject to change):

* User Guide - for new and existing customers (New Customer Document Pack to serve as base)

* Operations Guide - for customers' power and IT users (some content from the Installation Guide can be used here; will include scripting, decision tables, troubleshooting (sw and hw) and other technical info)

* Developer Guide - for customers' power users/developers and internal PW users

* Database Administrator's Guide - for customers' power users/developers and internal PW users

* Integrations Guide - can be for customers and internal PW users

* Installation Guides (divided into HW and SW) - for internal PW users

* Implementation Guide - for internal PW users

* Marketing Documentation - internal to PW, e.g. product literature (X5 and X6 models), if any. **NOTE: **Internal documents might need to be put somewhere else since GitHub Pages are open to the public.

**NOTE: **Work will be continuous, thus it may be possible that Phase 2 may finish ahead of schedule. If this happens, I will go ahead and proceed with the initial stage of Phase 3, or migrating the New Customer Document Pack to the new Documentation platform. This will serve as the template for the migration of the rest of the documents.
